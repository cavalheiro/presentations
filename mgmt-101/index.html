						## Management 101
						>  "Take an approach with people where you make people feel good about dealing with so that no matter what the outcome is they will continue to deal with you on other projects because they felt respected, they felt appreciation, and they felt in some kind of way they don't know what it was but it felt like a bond with you"

						- We have hard-wired ways of thinking 
						- We remember information selectively
						- We favor facts that confirm our existing ideas

						The effect is stronger for emotionally charged issues,<br>and for deeply entrenched beliefs.

						- Requires immediate feedback
						- Needs lots of practice

						Not good for complex adaptive systems!
